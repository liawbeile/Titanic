# Titanic  
## Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis using Python  

This is my first ever Exploratory Data Analysis project.   

I will be learning about & using Pandas and Seaborn for my data analysis and visualisation using the Titanic dataset.  

I'm super excited to get started. Let's find out who would most likely survive the Titanic and explore the factors that might have played a part in determining the fate of the passengers!
